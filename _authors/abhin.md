I've been writing software for a living for around 10 years. I have a wide variety of experiences in
the software industry. At the moment, I'm a Senior Data Engineer at Shopify. In the past, I've been
a Backend Engineer at Atlassian, working on Bitbucket Cloud.

I care deeply about learning the tools of my trade in detail and for finding interesting ways of
teaching them to people.
